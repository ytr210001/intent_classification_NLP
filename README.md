# Intent Classification for Customer Service Study


## Overview:
 Intent classification is a crucial aspect of natural language processing (NLP) that involves categorizing user queries or messages into predefined intent categories. In this project, we focus on utilizing the Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bitext/training-dataset-for-chatbotsvirtual-assistants to build and evaluate intent classification models tailored for customer service scenarios.

## Objective:

The primary objective of this study is to develop robust intent classification models for customer service applications. By leveraging real-world conversational data, the project aims to address the challenges and intricacies associated with understanding user intent in a customer service context.

## Key Components:

- **Dataset Exploration:** Analyze the Kaggle dataset to understand the distribution of intents and the characteristics of user queries within the customer service domain.

- **Intent Classification Techniques:** Explore various intent classification techniques, including traditional machine learning approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning models.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Understand how to evaluate the performance of intent classification models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Real-world Applications:** Discuss practical applications of intent classification in customer service, emphasizing its role in enhancing user experience and optimizing support processes.

## Project Structure:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the conversational data to ensure it is suitable for intent classification analysis.

2. **Baseline Models:** Implement baseline intent classification models to establish a foundation for performance comparison.

3. **Advanced Models:** Explore advanced intent classification models, incorporating techniques such as neural networks for improved accuracy.

4. **Evaluation:** Assess the performance of intent classification models using standard evaluation metrics and explore techniques for model improvement.
